### Environment setup
Before running this app locally, make sure you have all the required setup for react-native. Otherwise, please start setting up the environment mentioned [here]([url](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) before going on the installation.

* **NOTE**: Follow the tutorial until you reach to the **Creating a new application** title. It is not mandatory to follow that section but recommended to check if your environment was correctly setup.

### Download and run 
To download this project, open a terminal where it should be placed and run the following  command: 

```git clone https://github.com/Bmartin2013/shuttergram.git```

Then, move to the `shuttergram` folder by running:

```cd shuttergram``` 

And open a new terminal to install the libraries with 

```npm install```

Once you've installed all the packages, start the [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) bundler with

```npm start```. 

You should see the following screen:

Then, open a new tab and step into the project's folder by running 

```cd your_project_path/shuttergram```

Finally, run:

```npm run android```

The virtual device previously setup during the `Environment setup` step will launch. If everything's ok, you should see the following prints

Then run the project with `npm start` and press `a` in the Metro terminal to link your app with the selected device.

**And that's it!** now you can enjoy your app on a virtual device.

### Build a debug-apk

Once you are happy with your new code version, you can create a debug apk to try it in your phone. 

To do so, go to the project folder and run the following command 

```react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res```

Then, move to the android folder (`cd android`) and run:

```./gradlew assembleDebug```

And done! now you can check your app-debug.apk in the `./android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug` folder
